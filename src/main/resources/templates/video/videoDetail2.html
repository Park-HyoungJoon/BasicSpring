					<p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s
						supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists,
						tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
					<p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It
						has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer
						snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it
						often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for
						this exact same string of text.</p>
					<p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's
						a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body
						text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>First list item</li>
						<li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
						<li>Third list item to close it out</li>
					</ul>
					<p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>First list item</li>
						<li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
						<li>Third list item to close it out</li>
					</ol>
					<p>And this is a definition list:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
						<dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a
							Web page</dd>
						<dt>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</dt>
						<dd>Used to describe the appearance of Web content</dd>
						<dt>JavaScript (JS)</dt>
						<dd>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites
							and applications</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>
						HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list
						of which can be found on the <a
							href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla
							Developer Network</a>.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
						<li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
						<li>Abbreviations, like <abbr
							title="HyperText Markup Langage">HTML</abbr> should use <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>,
							with an optional <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>
							attribute for the full phrase.
						</li>
						<li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;</code>.
						</li>
						<li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;del&gt;</code>
							and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
						<li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sup&gt;</code>
							and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code
								class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sub&gt;</code>.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few
						modifications on our part.</p>
